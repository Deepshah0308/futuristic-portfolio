   - Recommended aspect ratio for project images: 16:9

### Customizing the Resume

1. Replace the sample resume:
   - Locate `public/sample-resume.pdf`
   - Replace it with your own PDF resume
   - Keep the filename as `sample-resume.pdf` or update the download link in `src/App.tsx`

### Updating Colors

The portfolio uses a modern dark theme with customizable accent colors:

- Primary: `#5E3AEE` (Purple)
- Accent: `#C56BF0` (Light Purple)
- Background: `#121212` (Dark)
- Text: `#FFFFFF` (White)

To change colors, search for these hex codes in `src/App.tsx` and replace them with your preferred colors.

### Setting Up the Contact Form

The portfolio uses [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) for handling form submissions. Both the contact form and hire me form will work automatically:

2. Change the form's action URL to include your email:
   ```html
   <form action="https://formsubmit.co/your@email.com" method="POST">
   ```
3. Replace `your@email.com` with your actual email address
4. That's it! FormSubmit will:
   - Send you an activation email
   - Start delivering form submissions to your inbox
   - Protect against spam

   - Keep the filename as `sample-resume.pdf` or update the download link in `src/App.tsx`

No sign-up or backend needed! Just change the email address and your form will work.
